			Pav Bhaji
		</div>
		<p>
			Pav bhaji is a fast food dish from India. It consists of a thick vegetable curry served with a soft bread roll. Vegetables in the curry may include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers, beans and tomatoes. Its origins are in the state of Maharashtra. Variants of the dish may use other bread varieties such as chappati, roti or brown bread. The dish originated in the 1850s as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai. Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city. Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to formal restaurants in India and abroad. Pav bhaji has many variations in ingredients and garnishes, but is essentially a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy, usually cooked on a flat griddle (tava) and served hot with a soft white bread roll.

			Vada Pav
		</div>
		<p>
			Vada pav, alternatively spelt vada pao, wada pav, or wada pao, About this soundpronunciation  is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chilli pepper. Although it originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger. The most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. The combination of the potato dumpling (batata vada) placed inside a pav quickly became popular in Girangaon and later the rest of Maharashtra. The favourite snacks in Maharashtra, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Marathis.One of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be Khidki Vada Pav located in Kalyan. It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pav from a window of their house facing the road.

			Dabeli
		</div>
		<p>
			Dabeli, kutchi dabeli or double roti is a popular snack food of India, originating in the Kutch or Kachchh region of Gujarat. It is a sweet snack made by mixing boiled potatoes with a special dabeli masala, putting the mixture in a ladi pav (burger bun), and serving it with chutneys made from tamarind, date, garlic, red chilies, etc. It is garnished with pomegranate and roasted peanuts. Dabeli literally means "pressed" in Gujarati language.It is said to be invented by one Keshavji Gabha Chudasama alias Kesha Malam, resident of Mandvi,and Mohan bavaji mandviKutch in the 1960s. When he started business he sold a dabeli at one anna or six paisa. His shop is still there in Mandvi and business is now carried by his next generations.Dabeli thus has its origin in Mandvi, a city of the Kutch region and even today dabeli masala made in the city are said to be most authentic.[citation needed] The dabeli is also, therefore, known as Kachchhi dabeli or Kutchi dabeli taking its cue from the region of its origin. Bhuj and Nakhatrana towns of Kutch are also known for authentic dabeli apart from Mandvi.
